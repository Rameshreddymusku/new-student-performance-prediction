📌 Project Overview

This project uses a Regression Machine Learning Model to predict a student’s exam score from multiple features such as:
	•	Study hours
	•	Attendance
	•	Family income
	•	Parental involvement
	•	Access to resources
	•	Teacher quality
	•	Sleep hours
	•	Motivation
	•	Peer influence
	•	School type
	•	Internet access
	•	Learning disabilities
	•	Distance from home
	•	Gender
	•	And more…

The objective is to apply the full ML workflow:
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis
	•	Data cleaning & preprocessing
	•	Feature engineering
	•	Model training & evaluation
	•	Saving model with joblib
	•	Deploying using Streamlit
